# Haresh-U-Capstone-Project

DE 2025-2026 Capstone Project - R/C Plane

## **Introduction**

I pursued this project with intent to update the quality of current R/C airplanes for hobbyists, by including quality-of-life features such as altitude hold and auto-landing. I wanted to make an R/C plane that accomodated these features. Unfortionately, I wan't able to get all the way to a fully functioning airplane, but I was able to make good progress and will continue this project throughout this year.

  I go into more detail about the project in my [digital notebook](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1Xd8hyVqAFlKc2oIBXLoqVHdMWL5ACztB0SyBCPcDpvg/edit?tab=t.0).
  
## **Parts Used**

For the electrical circuit, the main powerhouse of the airplane would be the HolyBro Kakute H743 Wing. This flight controller is capable of using a software called [ArduPilot](https://ardupilot.org/) which takes care of most of the software. Ardupilot has many features that tie more towards the fully autonomous flight, but it can still be used for assisted R/C flight.

The other components consist of the usual things that r/c airplanes have like servos, a motor, and battery. However, for additional features such as the ones listed in the introduction, other components are needed like a GPS and airspeedometer to detect height, position and airspeed.
